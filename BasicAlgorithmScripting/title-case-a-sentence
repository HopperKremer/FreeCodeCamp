/*
Return the provided string with the first letter of each word capitalized. Make sure the rest of the word is in lower case.

For the purpose of this exercise, you should also capitalize connecting words like "the" and "of".

Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck. Write your own code.

function titleCase(str) {

  var strArr = str.toLowerCase().split(" "); //Breaks up str into an all lower case array

  var toJoin = []; //We're going to copy to this variable 

  for (var i = 0; i < strArr.length; i++) { //Iterates through items in the arrays
    toJoin[i] = [];  // INITIATE THE NESTED ARRAY HERE
    for (var x = 0; x < strArr[i].length; x++) { //Iterates through chars of strArr & copies to toJoin

      if (x === 0) { //First char of word is capitalized before being copied
        toJoin[i][x] = strArr[i][x].toUpperCase();
      } else { //The rest of the chars are copied
        toJoin[i][x] = strArr[i][x];
      }

    }
  }
  return toJoin.join(" "); //Returns toJoin as a string
}
